# Devenv

This project contains all the files and scripts I use when creating a dev env.

## What's inside?

* simple init executable that can be used as PID 1 in a docker container
* Golang devenv, a go environment set up with some tools like gb, dlv to work on go code
  * generic image (godev)
  * personalized environment with my vim setup (mygodev)
