# This is a basic Fedora 21 spin designed to work in OpenStack and other
# private cloud environments. It's configured with cloud-init so it will
# take advantage of ec2-compatible metadata services for provisioning ssh
# keys. Cloud-init creates a user account named "fedora" with passwordless
# sudo access. The root password is empty and locked by default.
#
# Note that unlike the standard F20 install, this image has /tmp on disk
# rather than in tmpfs, since memory is usually at a premium.
#
# This kickstart file is designed to be used with ImageFactory (in Koji).
#
# To do a local build, you'll need to install ImageFactory.  See
# http://worknotes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cloudimages.html for some notes.
#
# For a TDL file, I store one here:
# https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fedora-atomic.git/tree/fedora-atomic-rawhide.tdl
# (Koji generates one internally...what we really want is Koji to publish it statically)
#
# Once you have imagefactory and imagefactory-plugins installed, run:
#
#   curl -O https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fedora-atomic.git/plain/fedora-atomic-rawhide.tdl
#   tempfile=$(mktemp --suffix=.ks)
#   ksflatten -v F22 -c fedora-cloud-base.ks > ${tempfile}
#   imagefactory --debug base_image --file-parameter install_script ${tempfile} fedora-atomic-rawhide.tdl
